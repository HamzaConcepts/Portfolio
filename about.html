          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            I'm Hamza — a multidisciplinary designer passionate about crafting purposeful brand identities and intuitive digital experiences.
            My work blends creativity with clarity, turning ideas into impactful visuals that help brands communicate who they are and why they matter.
            <br><br>
            Rooted in both design thinking and practical execution, I specialize in brand identity design, UI/UX design, and interactive digital platforms.
            Whether I’m shaping a startup’s visual language or designing interfaces for modern web and mobile experiences, I approach every project with intention, precision, and curiosity.

          <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
          <p>
            I believe good design should feel effortless — not because it’s simple, but because it’s thoughtfully structured.
            A well-crafted identity is more than a logo; it’s a complete visual ecosystem that evokes emotion, builds trust, and tells a consistent story across every touchpoint.
            <br><br>
            My design approach is grounded in strategy. I invest time in understanding the goals, values, and audience behind every brand.
            From there, I build identity systems and interfaces that are not only visually compelling but functionally sound — designed to scale and adapt without losing their essence.

          <p class="sub-head" style="margin-top: 0;">Brand Identity Design</p>
          <p>
            From logos to full-scale identity systems, I help brands define a cohesive visual language that sets them apart and builds recognition.

          <p class="sub-head">UI/UX Design</p>
          <p>
            I design intuitive user interfaces for websites and applications, combining usability with strong visual hierarchy and polish.

          <p class="sub-head">Web & App Development</p>
          <p>
            I’m fluent in front-end development, bringing designs to life with responsive layouts, interactive elements, and smooth performance.
            From static sites to dynamic dashboards, I bridge design and code seamlessly.

          <h2>Beyond the Work</h2>
          <p>
            Outside of design, I’m a casual chess ♟️ nerd who enjoys a good endgame puzzle and a sharp Sicilian defense.
            I’m also deeply fascinated by emerging technologies — always eager to explore the latest innovations, from AI to hardware breakthroughs.
            <br><br>
            My curiosity often translates into hands-on experimentation. I’ve built several small-scale automated systems that streamline daily tasks — from smart routines to camera-tracking rigs —
            merging my love for design with my interest in problem-solving through technology.
            <br><br>
            This blend of creativity, logic, and curiosity is what defines my process: thoughtful, detail-driven, and always evolving.
